## Obsidian Theme
Theme files I updated by customizing the css files of the Obsidian Notepad program.

## Installation
Depending on the operating system you use, find the ``.obsidian`` folder and create the ``themes`` folder in it (if it exists, you do not need to create it.)
Then clone the repository in the ``themes`` folder.
```py
git clone https://github.com/untk/untkTheme.git
```
Open Obsidian and select "untkTheme" from the themes selection section by going to "Settings > Appearance". and the transaction is completed.

## Support
I would be very happy if you leave a star to the repository.
